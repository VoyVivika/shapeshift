# Shapeshift 2.0.0
Shapeshift is a 3D Model Maker made for and with P3D (https://clickstore.clickteam.com/p3d_3d_framework)
This is a repository for Source Releases and Executable Releases.

Note: To open the .mfa source file requires Clickteam Fusion 2.5+, to make use of the MFA file you have to copy and paste the "P3D perspective projection engine" group from your P3D mfa into the shapeshift mfa where designated.
If you're looking for the previous iteration of Shapeshift you'll find it here https://github.com/VoyVivika/shapeshift1

Skybox is "Sky Box - Sunny Day" by The Chayed/Chayed Creates/KIIRA from OpenGameArt.org

Changes over original
- Points Detached from Tris/Quads (Allows easier editing of geometry by manipulating point objects instead of per-polygon points)
- Custom Camera
- 123 Importable Textures over original 50

Features Excluded from 1.x
- Lighting (for now this should be handled within your own application unless there is demand)
